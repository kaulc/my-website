            <h3>Ethics Essay</h3>
            <br>
            <h5>What is the purpose of having/following a "Code of Ethics"?
              When you are faced with an ethical situation, how do you personally go about making a decision?  
              What factors are involved in making your decision?
              What ethical issue(s) were discussed during class? 
              How did the ethical considerations introduced by your class differ from your own?   
              How were they alike?   Was your class able to come to a consensus on what the most "ethical" decision would be?  
              Reflect on the "Virtue of Ethics" as it relates to the case study your group discussed.    
              Choose three of the six virtues that you feel are most related to your case study and briefly write about them.   Why did you choose the three you did?   How are they relevant to the case study?   Why are the other virtues less relevant?   Is there another ethical virtue you feel could apply to your case study that is NOT included in the "Virtue of Ethics? "   Why or why not?
              </h5>
              <br>
              <p>The purpose of having a Code of Ethics is to set guidelines for all engineers to follow and to ensure all engineers up to the same standards of professionalism and morality. In a way, having a Code of Ethics unites all engineers by a basic standard of values. Following a Code of Ethics ensures that one acts in the most professional and moral ways in their day-to-day engineering activities. For example, engineers all over the world face ethical issues related to data privacy. Following a Code of Ethics means that as a whole, engineers will make privacy decisions considering the same values. Overtime, this means the progression of technology will lean towards “morally good” because of the ethical decisions of millions of engineers. 
              </p>
              <p>When I am faced with an ethical situation, I look to my morals and values to make the appropriate decision. I consider my role in the situation and who would be affected by my actions. Some examples of my personal morals and values include: kindness, empathy, and honesty. Though I have not faced a major ethical situation professionally, if I were faced with an ethical professional situation, I would look to my professional set of values, otherwise known as my Code of Ethics.  
              </p>
              There were many ethical issues discussed in class. Some issues that stood out were the dangers of social media algorithms and the ethical issues surrounding privacy and smart devices. The general theme of the discussions were how because technology and IoT are relatively new to society, there are no set guidelines for how we as a society should protect our privacy and regulate technology companies. 
              <p>
              In our discussions, we had a few differing opinions. For example, though I understand the value of protecting user privacy, I felt that heavy regulation on technology companies could cross the line into blatant government censorship. Some peers disagreed that regulation could lead to censorship, and stated the benefits of regulating technology companies were far more than the risks of censorship. I understood this counterargument. There needs to be a clear line between regulation and censorship, and a balance between the two. Everyone in my group agreed that there was no clear right or wrong in these situations, and that there was no simple solution to the issues of data privacy or regulation. It was difficult to come to consensus on the most ethical decision in each of the situations.
            </p>
              <p>The case study my group discussed was on the Amazon Echo privacy issue. In summary, there was a murder case where an Amazon Echo had the potential to provide much needed evidence to the case. My group discussed whether it was ethical for the police to request Amazon to release that user data since it would be used for a “good” cause in this particular case. 
              </p>
              <p>The three virtues that are the most relevant to this case are: integrity, responsibility, and self-discipline. I chose these three virtues because one must consider these three virtues when considering the parties influenced by a decision in the case. The other virtues are not less important to this case. In fact, one could argue that all six virtues are equally important in this case. But, considering the parties that would be directly influenced by a decision in this case -- the American people and the people involved in the criminal case -- integrity, responsibility, and self-discipline directly are the most important. 
              </p>
              <p>Integrity describes the moral uprightness and good judgement that must be exercised in day-to-day activities and important decisions. One must consistently adhere to their values and be honest in their intentions. With this particular case, one must consider the morally correct decision and exercise good judgement. One way of looking at this case using integrity is that the Amazon data would benefit the murder case, so the integral decision would be to release the data. 
              </p>
              <p>Responsibility describes accountability, trustworthiness, and dependability, along with the moral responsibility to do good. One always has a responsibility to act with good intentions in their day-to-day activities. With this particular case, the government has a responsibility to handle data from their citizens with good intentions and not take advantage of Amazon’s massive database of information. I would say the responsibility to provide the data does not bear on the shoulders of Amazon because Amazon is a private corporation. On the other hand, the entire purpose of the government is to act in a way that will protect its citizens from harm. 
              </p>
              <p>Self-discipline describes the act of not acting in excess and acting with restraint in life. One must not act in a way that excessively benefits one party over another. Again with this particular case, the government must exercise self-discipline and balance the benefits of solving the criminal case with the benefits of protecting its citizens’ privacy. 
              </p>
              <p>An relevant ethical virtue not included in the six Virtue Ethics is justice. Justice describes acting lawfully and fairly and restoring rightness. One could argue that the government must restore justice to the victim’s family by getting evidence by any means possible, even if that means possibly violating user data privacy.
